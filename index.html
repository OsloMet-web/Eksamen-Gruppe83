            <h2>OsloMET</h2>
            <p>
                Oslo Metropolitan University, also known as OsloMet, is an institution of higher education with a unique and dynamic 
                campus situated in the heart of Oslo, Norway. The university's campus is a testament to the city's rich history, 
                where former industrial buildings have been thoughtfully repurposed to serve as essential spaces for education, 
                research, and community engagement.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the notable buildings within the OsloMet campus is the former Frydenlund Bryggeri, which has been transformed 
                to accommodate various academic and administrative functions. These renovated spaces now include state-of-the-art 
                auditoriums, lecture halls, seminar rooms, meeting facilities, and office spaces. This adaptive reuse of the historical 
                brewery buildings adds a distinct character to the university and demonstrates OsloMet's commitment to preserving and 
                repurposing the city's heritage.
            </p>
            <h3>OsloMET, P35</h3>
            <p>
                P35, a standout building within the OsloMet campus, is a particularly noteworthy structure located at 
                Pilstredet 35, 0166 Oslo. This building has earned its nickname due to its distinctive address, and it plays a vital 
                role in the university's academic and administrative activities. P35 stands tall with its eight floors, as well as a 
                basement, making it a prominent fixture in the city's skyline. P35 serves as a hub of educational excellence, 
                offering a variety of facilities and resources to support OsloMet's academic mission. Its multifaceted nature makes 
                it a crucial part of the university's campus life, providing students, faculty, and staff with spaces for learning, 
                collaboration, and innovation. The unique combination of historical preservation and modern functionality at OsloMet, 
                including the iconic P35 building, reflects the university's commitment to offering a dynamic and engaging environment 
                for students and researchers. By reimagining and renovating these historic structures, OsloMet has created a campus that 
                bridges the past and the future, fostering a rich and inspiring atmosphere for education and research in the heart of Oslo.
