                this show the results from a web accessibility analysis using Lighthouse,
                 which assesses how well a website can be used by people with various perspectives.
                  The initial analysis revealed an accessibility score of 77, with two major issues identified:
                  the lack of sufficient contrast between background and foreground colors,
                   and the absence of a lang attribute in the "html" element, which is
                    essential for internationalization and assists screen readers in providing context for the content.
 
                 Following the changes we implemented, adding title and lang preferences
                 the accessibility score improved significantly to 90.
                 This improvement indicates that we have successfully addressed the highlighted issues
                  by likely enhancing the contrast ratio, which makes text easier to read for users with visual impairments,
                   and by adding the lang attribute, which helps in properly defining the language of the page content.
                    This attribute not only assists screen readers but also helps search engines understand the page content's intended audience.
 
                 Improving accessibility not only broadens the reach of our website to include users with disabilities ...
                  but also reflects positively on the overall user experience.
                 It's a key aspect of web development that has legal and ethical implications.
                  The improved score is a clear indicator of your commitment to making your website more inclusive and user-friendly.
                   It is important to continue to review and enhance accessibility features, as this is an ongoing process rather than a one-time fix.
                    Regular manual testing is recommended to ensure that all users have a seamless experience on your website.

                the results of an SEO (Search Engine Optimization) analysis performed using Lighthouse,
                a tool for improving the quality of web pages. Initially, our HTML page scored 80 in the SEO category,
                which indicated there was significant room for improvement. The first image highlights a specific
                issue where the page did not have a "meta name="viewport" tag,
                which is critical for ensuring the page is mobile-friendly.
                This tag helps browsers in scaling and rendering content appropriately on different devices.
               
               Upon making changes to our HTML code, we see an improvement in the SEO score,
                which has increased to 90 in the second image.
                This suggests that the modifications we made addressed the issues Lighthouse identified,
                particularly the absence of the viewport meta tag, and potentially other SEO best practices.
                It's important to note that while the Lighthouse tool offers guidance on technical aspects of SEO,
                it doesn't cover all factors that can influence search engine rankings,
                such as content quality, keyword optimization, and backlinks...
               
               This improvement demonstrates a positive step towards optimizing our web page for search engines,
                which can lead to better visibility and higher ranking in search results.
                Ensuring that our page follows the recommended SEO guidelines makes it more accessible and user-friendly,
                 especially for mobile users, which is increasingly important as mobile browsing continues to rise.
                It's always good practice to periodically check the pages with tools like Lighthouse to
                 identify and rectify issues that could impact a site's performance and user experience.
