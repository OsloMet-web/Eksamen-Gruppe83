                Social media platforms have recommendation systems that use an advance artificial intelligence algorithm
                to recommend us sites, or post who might be interested in based on previous data collected.
                These recommendations can be classified into, collaborated based systems and content-based systems.
                Collaborated based their algorithms on wisdom of the crowd, recommending what people who share the
                similar interest as u, also enjoys.
                Collaborated system is often used in streaming services such as Netflix and amazon, and often tell u
                that people who watched this movie also enjoy these.
                Content based system on the other hand based their algorithms on your previous data and recommends u new
                content that are similar to the previous one.
                For example, if u use google to search on new winter clothes, google have bult-in algorithms that
                catches this up and recommends u other pages of winter clothes.

                In health care machine learning is a valuable tool to use in order to be more efficient and collect big
                data in a way that is translatable and do-able even for doctors.
                Today there are many instances where machine learning is used for example monitoring patients’ mental
                health.
                By collecting big data, we are able to look at every single important detail from a patient and predict
                the possibility of certain diseases in the speed of milliseconds.
                By using this computer detected diagnoses, not only doctors can collect this data, since the AI write it
                own report, nurses can take over this part.
