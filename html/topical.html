        Social media platforms have recommendation systems that use an advance artificial intelligence algorithm to recommend us sites, or post who might be interested in based on previous data collected.
        These recommendations can be classified into, collaborated based systems and content-based systems.
        Collaborated based their algorithms on wisdom of the crowd, recommending what people who share the similar interest as u, also enjoys.
        Collaborated system is often used in streaming services such as Netflix and amazon, and often tell u that people who watched this movie also enjoy these.
        Content based system on the other hand based their algorithms on your previous data and recommends u new content that are similar to the previous one.
        For example, if u use google to search on new winter clothes, google have bult-in algorithms that catches this up and recommends u other pages of winter clothes.

        In health care machine learning is a valuable tool to use in order to be more efficient and collect big data in a way that is translatable and do-able even for doctors.
        Today there are many instances where machine learning is used for example monitoring patientsâ€™ mental health.
        By collecting big data, we are able to look at every single important detail from a patient and predict the possibility of certain diseases in the speed of milliseconds.
        By using this computer detected diagnoses, not only doctors can collect this data, since the AI write it own report, nurses can take over this part.

            Although there are many advantages, it also is some disadvantages to keep in mind both on a medical and IT level.
            One of the biggest challenges facing machine learning in health care is judging whether a report is good.
            Since the computer calculates with every variable given it can often lead to overdiagnosis and the doctor must be able to choose whether the data given is relevant enough to mention it.
            Challenges in an IT level can be improving the classification, detection, localization and system performance.
            There may also be a difficult task for the IT workers to visualise the data from the computer in a way that is interpretable for both doctors and nurses.
